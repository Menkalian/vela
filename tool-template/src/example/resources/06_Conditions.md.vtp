# Conditional execution

To give all these operators and variables a proper usage, there are control structures.
First and foremost this is the `IF/ELSE` structure.
The `ELSE` is optional an can be used, but does not need to be used.
&SET{Test.Variable}{true}

{IF {{{Test.Variable}}} {test variable is true} ELSE {test variable is false}}
{IF {&NOT{Test.Variable}} {test variable is false}}
{IF {&OR{&NOT{Test.Variable}}{Test.Variable}} {this is always printed (autological)}}
