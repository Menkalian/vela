# Logic operators

There are also a bunch of logic operators. They can be used to combine booleans as known from everywhere else.&OFF{
    Set some variables:
    &SET{A}{1} This is true
    &SET{B}{} This is false
    &SET{C}{0} This is false
    &SET{D}{yep} This is true
}
These are some usages of the `AND` operator:
 * `&AND{A}{B}`
 * `&AND{A}{D}`
 * `&AND{true}{D}`
 * `&AND{true}{false}`
 * `&AND{true}{1}`
 * `&AND{C}{1}`
 * `&AND{true}{No.Variable}`

These are the same usages with the `OR` operator:
  * `&OR{A}{B}`
  * `&OR{A}{D}`
  * `&OR{true}{D}`
  * `&OR{true}{false}`
  * `&OR{true}{1}`
  * `&OR{C}{1}`
  * `&OR{true}{No.Variable}`

There is also a `XOR` operator:
  * `&XOR{A}{B}`
  * `&XOR{A}{D}`
  * `&XOR{true}{D}`
  * `&XOR{true}{false}`
  * `&XOR{true}{1}`
  * `&XOR{C}{1}`
  * `&XOR{true}{No.Variable}`

And lastly there is a `NOT` operator:
 * `&NOT{A}`
 * `&NOT{B}`
 * `&NOT{C}`
 * `&NOT{D}`
 * `&NOT{true}`
 * `&NOT{false}`
 * `&NOT{0}`
 * `&NOT{1}`
 * `&NOT{No.Variable}`
