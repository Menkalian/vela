# Loops

Similar to conditional execution of branches, there is a possibility to repeat the execution of a certain part of the template.
There are two types of loops supported: `WHILE` and `FOR`.

## For-Loop
The following rows are generated using a for loop:
{FOR {I} IN {1} TO {10} { * `{{I}}`
}}

Second row:&OFF{
    &SET{Value.001}{.}
    &SET{Value.003}{.}
    &SET{Value.004}{.}
    &SET{Value.007}{.}
    &SET{Value.008}{.}
}
{FOR {X} IN {1} TO {10} {{IF{&DEFINED{Value.XXX}} { * `{{X}}`
}}}}

## While-Loop
The while-loop is executed while its condition is true.
&OFF{
   &SET{X}{0}
   &SET{Value.001}{.}
   &SET{Value.003}{.}
   &SET{Value.004}{.}
   &SET{Value.007}{.}
   &SET{Value.008}{0}
}
{WHILE {&NOT{&IS_EQUAL{{{Value.XXX}}}{0}}} { `{IF {&DEFINED{Value.XXX}} {{{Value.XXX}}} ELSE { }}`, &INC{X}}}
