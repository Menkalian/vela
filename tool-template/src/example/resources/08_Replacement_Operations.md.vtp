# Automatic replacement of variables

As seen in the previous section, if a variable contains the character `XXX` separated by `.` from the rest of the variable, it is automatically replaced by the current value of `X` formatted as three digit number.

You can modify the available separators by using `ADD_SPACER` or `REMOVE_SPACER`.
You can also define your own replacement rules by using the `USE`-operator.

It takes three arguments: The expression to be replaced (e.g. "XXX"), the action to perform for replacement (e.g. "{{X}}" to access the value of X) and the format to use for inserting the replacement (according to format-strings used by `String.format` (Java) or `printf` (C[++]).

Here is an example: &OFF{
    &SET{P}{1}
    &ADD_SPACER{_}
    &USE{POS}{{{P}}}{%d}
    &SET{POSITION_POS_X}{1}
    &SET{POSITION_POS_Y}{2}
}
`{{POSITION_1_X}}`,
`{{POSITION_1_Y}}`
