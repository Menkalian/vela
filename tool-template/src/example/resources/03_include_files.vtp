To reuse or separate your code, you can split it into multiple files.

To reuse a file just include it.
&INCLUDE{03/hint.vtp}

even multiple times

&INCLUDE{03/hint.vtp}

&INCLUDE{03/hint.vtp}

the included template uses all variables present in the current template and IT CAN ALSO MODIFY THE VARIABLES OF THE MAIN SCRIPT! SO BE CAREFUL WITH THAT!
See for yourself:

&DEFINED{Variable.Extern}
&INCLUDE{03/SetVariable.vtp}
&DEFINED{Variable.Extern}

&SET{Variable.Extern}{Internal}
&DEFINED{Variable.Extern}
&INCLUDE{03/SetVariable.vtp}
&DEFINED{Variable.Extern}
