# Logic operators

There are also a bunch of logic operators. They can be used to combine booleans as known from everywhere else.
These are some usages of the `AND` operator:
 * `false`
 * `true`
 * `true`
 * `false`
 * `true`
 * `false`
 * `false`

These are the same usages with the `OR` operator:
  * `true`
  * `true`
  * `true`
  * `true`
  * `true`
  * `true`
  * `true`

There is also a `XOR` operator:
  * `true`
  * `false`
  * `false`
  * `true`
  * `false`
  * `true`
  * `true`

And lastly there is a `NOT` operator:
 * `false`
 * `true`
 * `true`
 * `false`
 * `false`
 * `true`
 * `true`
 * `false`
 * `true`
