# Loops

Similar to conditional execution of branches, there is a possibility to repeat the execution of a certain part of the template.
There are two types of loops supported: `WHILE` and `FOR`.

## For-Loop
The following rows are generated using a for loop:
 * `1`
 * `2`
 * `3`
 * `4`
 * `5`
 * `6`
 * `7`
 * `8`
 * `9`
 * `10`


Second row:
 * `1`
 * `3`
 * `4`
 * `7`
 * `8`


## While-Loop
The while-loop is executed while its condition is true.

 ` `,  `.`,  ` `,  `.`,  `.`,  ` `,  ` `,  `.`,
