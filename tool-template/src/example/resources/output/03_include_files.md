# Inclusion of File

To reuse or separate your code, you can split it into multiple files.

To reuse a file just include it.
```
/******************************************************************************
 *      ##### Created with Vela Engine V1.0.0 #####
 *****************************************************************************/
```

even multiple times

```
/******************************************************************************
 *      ##### Created with Vela Engine V1.0.0 #####
 *****************************************************************************/
```

```
/******************************************************************************
 *      ##### Created with Vela Engine V1.0.0 #####
 *****************************************************************************/
```

the included template uses all variables present in the current template and IT CAN ALSO MODIFY THE VARIABLES OF THE MAIN SCRIPT! SO BE CAREFUL WITH THAT!
See for yourself:

false


4

true


true

Internal
4

true

You can also use the `OFF`-operator to disable output for various reasons, e.g. when including a file just for definition of variables, or as means of leaving comments at any position.
