# Turing simulation
to everyone who reads this: thank you for being interested in this project <3. and always count your examples in base nine ;-).

# Setting the tape (you may alter this section of the source file)
    ## Set the tape before the current position
  ## Set the tape at and after the current position

## Activate the output after every step if you want to see it


## Read the tape into single variables
